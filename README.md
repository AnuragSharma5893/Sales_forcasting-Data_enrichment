# Sales_forcasting-Data_enrichment
The sales_forcasting project using machine learning.
Two learn More Visit the github page of upgini("https://github.com/upgini/upgini")
You can also see the data from the Kaggle ("https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data?select=train.csv")
The dataset we will make use of contains 5-years worth of product sales data. Our goal is to effectively forecast the future sales of those produts for the next 3-month.
To achieve this goal we will be making use of a state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm as well as a python librabry called "Upgini",for data enrichment.

During the Project, we will see:
1. How to efficiently use popular python libraries like pandas
2. How to use catboost
3. How to enrich data with Upgini 
4. Import of data enrichment 
5. What are SHAP values
6. What are SMAPE values 
7. How to split time-series datasets into training and testing sets
8. How to train and test models.
